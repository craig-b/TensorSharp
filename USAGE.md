## Compute Backends

| Backend | Flag | Best fit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct CUDA/cuBLAS | `--backend cuda` | NVIDIA inference and experimentation | Uses the CUDA Driver API, cuBLAS GEMM, PTX kernels for common float32 ops (fill, unary, binary, ternary, activations, RMSNorm, softmax, RoPE/RoPEEx, SDPA, GQA prefill/decode, causal mask, gather/concat), and native quantized matmul/get-rows for supported GGUF quant types. Unsupported ops route through CPU fallbacks while preserving tensor semantics. |
| MLX Metal | `--backend mlx` | Apple Silicon (alternative to GGML Metal) | GPU-accelerated path built on [mlx-c](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c). Implements quantized ops (Q4_K_M, Q8_0, Q5_K, Q6_K, IQ2_XXS, IQ4_XS, IQ4_NL, MXFP4, etc.) without dequantizing to FP32, fused decode/prefill Metal kernels (fused QKV preprocess, fused gate+up+SiLUMul MoE, fused multi-dim KV write), compiled-graph kernels, async worker dispatch with periodic `async_eval` to overlap GPU/CPU work, batched MoE decode with stacked expert weight slabs, MoE expert offload, GGUF mmap pinned in physical RAM via `mlock(2)`, host-derived allocator caps (`TS_MLX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` / `TS_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_MB` / `TS_MLX_WIRED_LIMIT_MB`), and a CPU fallback for ops that aren't yet wired up. Requires `libmlxc` (built locally by `TensorSharp.Backends.MLX/build-native-macos.sh` or located via `TENSORSHARP_MLX_LIBRARY` / `TENSORSHARP_MLX_LIBRARY_DIR`). |
| GGML Metal | `--backend ggml_metal` | Apple Silicon (default on macOS) | GPU-accelerated via Apple Metal. Quantized weights are mapped zero-copy from the GGUF file into Metal command buffers via host-pointer buffers, so the resident set stays close to the on-disk model size. |
| GGML CUDA | `--backend ggml_cuda` | NVIDIA inference through ggml | GPU-accelerated via GGML CUDA on Windows or Linux. Quantized weights are uploaded to device memory once at load time and the host copy is released afterwards. |
| GGML Vulkan | `--backend ggml_vulkan` | Vendor-neutral GPU inference through ggml | GPU-accelerated via GGML Vulkan on Windows or Linux — runs on AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs with a Vulkan 1.3 driver, using cooperative-matrix shaders (KHR coopmat / NV coopmat2) where the driver supports them. Weights are device-resident like GGML CUDA and the same fused whole-model decode/prefill graphs are used. Enabled automatically at native build time when the machine has a Vulkan runtime (loader installed); the build downloads a portable Vulkan toolchain (headers, glslc, SPIRV-Headers, and on Windows a loader import lib) via `eng/fetch-vulkan-toolchain.ps1` / `eng/fetch-vulkan-toolchain.sh` when no Vulkan SDK or distro dev packages are installed. Opt out with `--no-vulkan` (or `TENSORSHARP_GGML_NATIVE_ENABLE_VULKAN=OFF`). |
| GGML CPU | `--backend ggml_cpu` | Native CPU kernels | CPU inference using native GGML with optimized kernels. Quantized weights are mapped zero-copy from the GGUF file. |
| Pure C# CPU | `--backend cpu` | Portability and debugging | Portable CPU inference with no native dependencies. |

**DeepSeek V4 Flash is the exception to the table above.** Its 284B compressed-sparse-attention MoE stack runs through one of three dedicated whole-model executors rather than the generic per-op path: a direct-CUDA engine (`--backend cuda`), the native ggml executor (`--backend ggml_cuda` / `ggml_vulkan`), and a 100% pure-C# CPU executor (`--backend cpu`) that serves quantized weights straight from the memory-mapped GGUF shards. All three layer-split the weights across every visible GPU (or, on CPU, stream them from the mapped shards), so a model far larger than one card still runs. See the [DeepSeek V4 card](docs/models/deepseek4.md).

**GLM 5.x (`glm-dsa`) is the other exception.** Its 744B-A40B MLA + sparse-attention MoE runs through a native whole-model ggml executor on `--backend ggml_cuda` / `ggml_vulkan` / `ggml_cpu` / `ggml_metal`, and through a managed per-op path on `--backend cpu` (100% managed, no native dependencies) and `--backend cuda`; `TS_GLM_NATIVE=0` selects the managed path on a GGML backend for an A/B. The 6-shard split GGUF is handled by `GgufFile` itself — point `--model` at the `-00001-of-00006` shard. MLX does not run it. See the [GLM card](docs/models/glm.md).

## Configuration file (CLI + Server)

Both `TensorSharp.Cli` and `TensorSharp.Server` can read their options from a JSON
file passed with `--config`, instead of (or in addition to) a long command line:

```bash
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --config config/server-basic.json
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll       --config config/cli-basic.json
```

**Command-line options always win.** File values are applied first, then anything
you also pass on the command line overrides them — so one file can be reused across
machines while you override just what differs (`--config config/server-basic.json --backend ggml_cpu`).
Repeat `--config` to layer files; later files win over earlier ones.

The keys are the same long option names listed below (with or without the leading
`--`). Comments (`//`, `/* */`) and trailing commas are allowed.

| JSON value | Becomes | Example |
|---|---|---|
| string / number | `--key value` | `"max-tokens": 4096` → `--max-tokens 4096` |
| `true` | the bare switch `--key` | `"continuous-batching": true` → `--continuous-batching` |
| `false` / `null` | nothing (use the negation key, e.g. `"no-continuous-batching": true`) | |
| array | a repeated flag | `"stop": ["</s>", "<\|eot\|>"]` → `--stop </s> --stop <\|eot\|>` |
| object | a downloadable file (see below) | `{ "path": "...", "urls": ["..."] }` |

**Variables.** Define shared values once under `"variables"` and reference them
with `${name}` in any string value. A `${name}` not defined there falls back to an
environment variable of the same name, and variables may reference other variables.
Declare as many roots as you need — models in different folders each get their own.

```json
{
  "variables": { "modelRoot": "C:/models" },
  "backend": "ggml_cuda",
  "model": "${modelRoot}/Qwen3.5-9B-Q8_0.gguf",
  "mmproj": "${modelRoot}/Qwen3.5-mmproj-F16.gguf"
}
```

**Auto-download.** Any file option can be an object with a local `path` and one or
more `urls` instead of a plain string. If `path` is missing it is downloaded from
the first working URL (mirrors are tried in order), saved there, and reused on every
later run; download progress is printed to stderr. An optional `sha256` verifies a
freshly downloaded file.

```json
{
  "backend": "ggml_cuda",
  "model": {
    "path": "C:/models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q8_0.gguf",
    "urls": [ "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3.5-9B-Q8_0.gguf" ]
  }
}
```

Ready-to-use examples live in [`config/`](config/) (`cli-basic.json`,
`server-basic.json`, `variables.json`, `auto-download.json`, `qwen-image-edit.json`)
— each uses real, public, ungated URLs, so it works on a fresh machine. See
[`config/README.md`](config/README.md) for the full reference.

## Console Application

Running `TensorSharp.Cli` with no arguments prints the full parameter reference —
every option with its description, default, range, and an example — and exits
before any logging or model machinery starts; `--help` (also `-h`, `-?`, `/?`)
does the same.

**Command-line options:**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--model <path>` | Path to a GGUF model file (required) |
| `--input <path>` | Text file containing the user prompt |
| `--input-jsonl <path>` | JSONL file with batch requests (one JSON per line) |
| `--multi-turn-jsonl <path>` | JSONL file for multi-turn chat simulation with KV cache reuse |
| `--output <path>` | Write generated text to this file |
| `--image <path>` | Image file for vision inference |
| `--video <path>` | Video file for video inference |
| `--audio <path>` | Audio file (WAV, MP3, OGG) for audio inference |
| `--pdf <path>` | PDF document input (one-shot mode). Born-digital PDFs have their complete text layer extracted and inlined into the prompt (page cap via `TS_PDF_MAX_PAGES`); scanned PDFs are rasterized to page images and require a vision model (`--mmproj` or a built-in vision encoder). `--input` text becomes the instruction over the document. |
| `--mmproj <path>` | Path to the multimodal projector GGUF file |
| `--max-tokens <N>` | Maximum tokens to generate (default: 100) |
| `--backend <type>` | Compute backend: `cpu`, `cuda`, `mlx`, `ggml_cpu`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan` |
| `--gpu-device <N>` | Vulkan device index for the `ggml_vulkan` backend on multi-GPU hosts (e.g. an integrated Intel GPU next to a discrete NVIDIA one). Defaults to device 0; use `--list-gpus` to see the indices. Also settable via the `TS_GGML_VULKAN_DEVICE` env var. |
| `--list-gpus` | List the Vulkan devices ggml-vulkan can see (index + adapter name) and exit |
| `--n-cpu-moe <N>` / `-ncmoe <N>` | Keep the routed Mixture-of-Experts weights of the first N layers in system RAM and multiply them on the CPU; attention, norms, the router and the always-active shared expert stay on the accelerator (llama.cpp's `--n-cpu-moe` equivalent). This is what lets a 35B-A3B MoE fit beside a long-context KV cache on a 12-16 GB card. Pass `all` for every layer. Default: 0 on every architecture, DeepSeek V4 and GLM 5.x included — a model that does not fit is refused at load with the number of layers that would make it fit, rather than silently offloaded (env `TS_N_CPU_MOE`). |
| `--cpu-moe` / `-cmoe` | Shorthand for `--n-cpu-moe all`. Default: off (env `TS_CPU_MOE`). |
| `--cpu-moe-threads <N>` | Worker threads for the host-side expert matmul. Default: **half** the CPU parallelism this process can actually use (`hardware_concurrency` clamped by the scheduler affinity mask and the cgroup CPU quota) on hosts with more than 8, all but one below that. The other half is not waste — the accelerator submission threads, and in `TensorSharp.Server` Kestrel and the scheduler, have to be schedulable too, and .NET sizes its own pool from the machine's CPU count rather than the cgroup quota. Sizing this near the quota is a cliff, not a slope: on a 95-CPU quota the hosted 26B MoE measured 20.7 tok/s at 64 threads and 8.2 at 71. Raise it on a dedicated box (env `TS_CPU_MOE_THREADS`). |

**Backend support.** MoE CPU offload is implemented on the GGML backends
(`ggml_cuda`, `ggml_vulkan`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cpu`) for every MoE
architecture, and on the pure-C# `cuda` backend for DeepSeek V4 only — that
engine serves experts from its own stacked-expert device buffer everywhere
else. Asking for offload on a combination that does not implement it prints a
`[moe-offload] WARNING` and proceeds without saving VRAM, rather than failing
quietly. Measured on gemma-4-26B-A4B (`--cpu-moe`, peak VRAM): `ggml_cuda`
15244 → 5756 MiB; `cuda` 14261 → 14253 MiB (no-op, warns).
| `--kv-cache-dtype <type>` | KV cache precision: `f32`, `f16`, `q8_0`, or `q4_0` (default: auto — the backend/model pick; env `KV_CACHE_DTYPE`). Half-precision / quantized KV caches reduce memory at the cost of small numerical drift; `q4_0` (~0.56 bytes/elem, ~1/7 of f32) is the most aggressive tier for very long (128K–256K) contexts where the KV cache dominates memory. Block-quantized caches (`q8_0`/`q4_0`) require the native GGML flash path. |
| `--interactive` / `-i` | Start an interactive REPL chat session (turn-by-turn input/output) with KV cache reuse, slash commands, hot-swappable model/backend/projector, file attachments (image, audio, video, text) and live sampling tuning. See the **Interactive REPL commands** section below for the full list. |
| `--system <text>` | System prompt to seed the interactive session (overridden inside the REPL by `/system`) |
| `--system-file <path>` | Read the initial system prompt from a UTF-8 text file (alternative to `--system`) |
| `--think` | Enable thinking/reasoning mode (chain-of-thought). Opt-in on every family, GLM 5.x included: without it the GLM template closes the reasoning block immediately (`<think></think>`) so the model answers directly, and with it the prompt carries `Reasoning Effort: Max` and leaves the block open for the model to close. `/think on\|off` toggles it inside the REPL. |
| `--tools <path>` | JSON file with tool/function definitions. Wire formats differ by family and the parser is picked from the architecture — GLM 5.x emits XML (`<tool_call>NAME<arg_key>k</arg_key><arg_value>v</arg_value></tool_call>`, one element per argument, values `tojson`-encoded when they are not plain strings) rather than a JSON body, and the server parses that back into the usual OpenAI tool-call fields so clients see the standard shape. |
| `--draft-model <path>` | Speculative-decoding drafter GGUF for architectures whose drafter ships as its own file — DeepSeek V4's DSpark support module (see [DeepSeek V4](docs/models/deepseek4.md#dspark-speculative-decoding)) and Muse-Glimmer's DFlash block drafter (see [Muse-Glimmer](docs/models/muse-glimmer.md#3-dflash-speculative-decoding); env `TS_MUSE_GLIMMER_DFLASH`). It drafts a whole block per step and the trunk verifies it in one batched forward, so greedy output is unchanged. Engages on every single-sequence path (`--input`, `--input-jsonl`, `--multi-turn-jsonl`, `--interactive`) with `--backend cuda` or `--backend ggml_cuda`, and requires a pure-argmax sampler: any temperature, top-k/p, or repetition/presence/frequency penalty turns it off. Env: `TS_DSV4_DSPARK`. |
| `--spec-draft-n-max <N>` | Cap on tokens drafted per speculative block (default: the drafter's trained block size — 5 for DSpark, 15 for Muse-Glimmer's DFlash) |
| `--spec-draft-conf-min <p>` | Minimum cumulative acceptance probability — the product of the confidence head's per-position estimates — for a drafted position to be kept (default: `0.35`). Lower drafts further and rolls back more; higher falls back to plain decode more often. |
| `--temperature <f>` | Sampling temperature (0 = greedy) |
| `--top-k <N>` | Top-K filtering (0 = disabled) |
| `--top-p <f>` | Nucleus sampling threshold (1.0 = disabled) |
| `--min-p <f>` | Minimum probability filtering (0 = disabled) |
| `--repeat-penalty <f>` | Repetition penalty (1.0 = none) |
| `--presence-penalty <f>` | Presence penalty (0 = disabled) |
| `--frequency-penalty <f>` | Frequency penalty (0 = disabled) |
| `--seed <N>` | Random seed (-1 = non-deterministic) |
| `--stop <string>` | Stop sequence (can be repeated) |
| `--dump-prompt` | Render the prompt + tokenization and exit (no generation) |
| `--benchmark` | Run a synthetic prefill/decode throughput benchmark |
| `--bench-prefill <N>` | Synthetic prefill length in tokens (default: 32) |
| `--bench-decode <N>` | Synthetic decode length in tokens (default: 64) |
| `--bench-runs <N>` | Number of benchmark runs; reports best and average (default: 1) |
| `--bench-kvcache` | Run a multi-turn KV-cache reuse benchmark (with-cache vs forced-reset prefill) |
| `--bench-kv-turns <N>` | Number of conversation turns for `--bench-kvcache` (default: 4, max: 8) |
| `--bench-chunked` | Run a chunked-prefill micro-benchmark (Gemma 4) |
| `--warmup-runs <N>` | Number of throw-away forward passes before timing real text / multimodal prompts (default: 0) |
| `--test-chunked-prefill` | Run the chunked-prefill correctness check (compares chunked vs non-chunked logits) |
| `--correct-prefill <N>` | Prompt length used by `--test-chunked-prefill` |
| `--correct-decode <N>` | Decode length used by `--test-chunked-prefill` |
| `--diffusion-steps <N>` | DiffusionGemma denoising steps per block (default: 48). For Qwen-Image-Edit, the FlowMatch-Euler step count — omit for auto (30, or the step count of a loaded Lightning LoRA). |
| `--diffusion-seed <N>` | DiffusionGemma deterministic sampler seed (default: 0) |
| `--diffusion-blocks <N>` | DiffusionGemma block-autoregressive canvas count. `0` derives the count from `--max-tokens` and the model canvas length. |
| `--image <path>` | Input image for Qwen-Image-Edit (also the image input for multimodal chat). Required to trigger image-edit mode on a `qwen_image` DiT GGUF. |
| `--prompt <text>` | Qwen-Image-Edit edit instruction (falls back to `--input` file contents if omitted). |
| `--output <path>` | Qwen-Image-Edit output PNG path (default: `edited.png`). |
| `--cfg <F>` | Qwen-Image-Edit true-CFG guidance scale (`<= 1` disables the negative pass). Omit for auto: 2.5 (the Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 recommendation; 4.0 over-guides and distorts faces), or 1.0 when a Lightning LoRA is loaded. Shares `--diffusion-steps` / `--diffusion-seed` for step count and seed. |
| `--qwen-image-vae <path>` | Override the resolved Qwen-Image VAE companion (`.gguf` or `.safetensors`). |
| `--qwen-image-vl <path>` | Override the resolved Qwen2.5-VL-7B text-encoder GGUF. |
| `--qwen-image-mmproj <path>` | Override the resolved Qwen2.5-VL mmproj (vision grounding) GGUF. |
| `--qwen-image-lora <path>` | Qwen-Image-Edit Lightning distillation LoRA (`.safetensors`). Applied as a runtime F32 side-path next to each targeted projection (`y = W_quant·x + b + (alpha/rank)·up·(down·x)`) with the quantized base weights left untouched — **not** merged into them. Auto-derives the step count from the file name (e.g. 4 or 8), switches CFG to 1.0 and pins the timestep shift to 3, so the default 30 steps × 2 CFG passes (60 DiT forwards) become 4–8. Needs the whole-model or fused per-block CUDA forward — on a path without the side-path it throws rather than emitting noise. Env: `TS_QWEN_IMAGE_LORA`. |
| `--width <px>` / `--height <px>` | Output size for Qwen-Image-Edit and Wan video. Default: `0` — auto (Qwen-Image-Edit: the source size, VRAM-clamped; Wan: the model's native area at the input image's aspect ratio, 1280×704 for TI2V-5B and 832×480 otherwise). |
| `--video-frames <N>` | Wan video frame count, snapped to `4k+1` (default: 33; 49 for Wan2.2-TI2V). `1` generates a still image (use `--output out.png`). |
| `--fps <N>` | Wan video playback frame rate of the saved MP4 (default: 16; 24 for Wan2.2-TI2V). |
| `--flow-shift <F>` | Wan FlowMatch timestep shift (default: the model's official recipe — 5.0 for Wan 2.2, 12.0 for A14B T2V, 8.0/3.0/5.0 for Wan 2.1). |
| `--sampler <name>` | Wan sampler: `unipc` (official Wan sampler, default) or `euler`. |
| `--negative-prompt <text>` | Wan negative prompt (default: the official Wan negative prompt). |
| _(step-distilled checkpoints)_ | Auto-detected from the DiT file name (`Turbo`, `distill`, `Lightning`, `lightx2v`, `FastWan`, `-dmd`, or an explicit `…-4steps-…` / `…8step…` for 1–16): the pipeline switches to that step count with guidance off, turning the official 50-step × CFG recipe's 100 DiT passes into 4. This is the single biggest speed lever for Wan — see **[Video generation (Wan)](#video-generation-wan)** below. `--diffusion-steps` / `--cfg` override it. |
| `--cfg-cache-stride <N>` | Wan guidance cache: run the unconditional CFG pass on one step in `N` and reuse the cached guidance direction in between (default off — every step runs both passes). `2` ≈ 1.30x faster, `3` ≈ 1.43x; approximate, so leave it off when matching a reference sample matters. |
| `--wan-vae <path>` | Override the resolved Wan video VAE (`wan_2.1_vae.safetensors` / `Wan2.2_VAE.safetensors`). Env: `TS_WAN_VAE`. |
| `--wan-te <path>` | Override the resolved UMT5-XXL text-encoder GGUF. Env: `TS_WAN_TE`. Wan 2.2 A14B additionally resolves the second high/low-noise expert automatically (env: `TS_WAN_DIT2`). |
| `--tp <N>` | Tensor parallelism degree — split the model across N GPUs in a single process (default: `1`). Requires `--backend cuda`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan`. See [Tensor Parallelism & Distributed Inference](#tensor-parallelism--distributed-inference). |
| `--tp-node-id <N>` | This node's 0-based ID for multi-node (distributed) tensor parallelism. Requires `--tp-peers`. |
| `--tp-peers <list>` | Comma-separated `host:port` list of all nodes in the distributed TP cluster (e.g. `192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500`). Requires `--tp-node-id`. |
| `--test` | Run built-in tokenizer + Qwen3 chat-template + ollama-comparison tests |
| `--test-templates <dir>` | Validate hardcoded chat templates against GGUF Jinja2 templates for every *.gguf in `<dir>` |
| `--config <path>` | Read options from a JSON config file (command-line options override it). Supports `${variables}` and auto-downloading models via `{ "path": ..., "urls": [...] }`. Repeatable. See [Configuration file](#configuration-file-cli--server). |
| `--log-level <lvl>` | Console + file logger level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, `off` |
| `--log-dir <path>` | Directory for the JSON-line file logger (default: `<binDir>/logs`) |
| `--log-file <0\|1>` | Disable (`0`) or enable (`1`) the file logger (default: enabled) |
| `--log-console <0\|1>` | Disable (`0`) or enable (`1`) the console logger (default: enabled) |

The CLI recognizes a small set of legacy projector filenames beside the model, but current repositories often use different names. Pass the downloaded file explicitly with `--mmproj` for reliable multimodal runs. `TensorSharp.Server` never auto-detects the projector.

**JSONL input format:**

Each line is a JSON object with `messages`, optional `prompt`, and optional sampling parameters:

```json
{"id": "q1", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+3?"}], "max_tokens": 50}
{"id": "q2", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku."}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.8}
```

**Interactive REPL commands:**

Once the CLI is launched with `--interactive` / `-i`, you can drive the running session with slash commands. Type `/help` (or `/?`) inside the REPL for the same list. Anything that does not start with `/` is treated as a user turn.

The prompt header summarizes the current state on every turn — model, backend, architecture, context length, projector, conversation depth, and any attachments queued for the next turn (e.g. `[turn 3 (2 attachments pending)]> `). Press Ctrl+C while generating to interrupt the current reply; press Ctrl+C at the prompt to exit.

Conversation:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help`, `/?` | Show all interactive commands |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Leave the session |
| `/reset`, `/new` | Clear conversation history and KV cache |
| `/history` | Print the conversation history |
| `/save <file>` | Append the current transcript to a UTF-8 file |
| `/system <text>` | Set the system prompt (empty argument clears it). Resets KV cache. |
| `/think on\|off` | Toggle thinking/reasoning mode for supported models |
| `/multiline on\|off` | Toggle multi-line input (terminate the message with a single `.` on its own line) |

Model and runtime:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/info`, `/status` | Show the loaded model, backend, architecture, context/vocab size, projector, conversation depth, and pending attachments |
| `/model <path>` | Load a different `.gguf` model on the current backend (resets the session) |
| `/backend <name>` | Reload the current model on a different backend: `cpu`, `cuda`, `mlx`, `ggml_cpu`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan` |
| `/mmproj <path>` | Load (or replace) the multimodal projector for the current model. Aliases: `/projector` |

Sampling (live, persists across turns):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/sampling`, `/show` | Print the current sampling configuration |
| `/max <N>` | Maximum reply length in tokens |
| `/temp <float>` | Sampling temperature (0 = greedy) |
| `/topk <int>` | Top-K filtering (0 = disabled) |
| `/topp <float>` | Top-P / nucleus threshold (1.0 = disabled) |
| `/minp <float>` | Min-P filtering (0 = disabled) |
| `/repeat <float>` | Repetition penalty (1.0 = none) |
| `/presence <float>` | Presence penalty |
| `/frequency <float>` | Frequency penalty |
| `/seed <int>` | Random seed (-1 = non-deterministic) |
| `/stop <text>` | Add a stop sequence |
| `/clearstop` | Remove all stop sequences |

Uploads (queued for the next user turn, then auto-cleared after the turn):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/image <path>`, `/img <path>` | Attach an image (vision-capable models only) |
| `/audio <path>` | Attach an audio file (Gemma 4) |
| `/video <path>`, `/vid <path>` | Attach a video; frames are extracted automatically (Gemma 4) |
| `/text <path>`, `/file <path>`, `/txt <path>` | Inline up to the first 256 KiB of a UTF-8 text/markdown/csv/code file into the next prompt |
| `/clearattach` | Drop any pending image/audio/video/text attachments without sending a turn |

Quoted paths (single or double quotes) are accepted, so drag-and-drop from a file manager works on macOS. Multimodal commands require a multimodal projector to be loaded — pass `--mmproj` at startup or use `/mmproj <path>` from the REPL.

## Web Application

Run these commands from the repository root after building:

```bash
# Start the server with the exact hosted model
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model ./models/model.gguf --backend ggml_metal

# Linux + NVIDIA GPU
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model ./models/model.gguf --backend ggml_cuda

# Multimodal models: host an explicit projector too
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model ./models/model.gguf --mmproj ./models/mmproj.gguf --backend ggml_cuda

# Wan video generation: use 121 frames at 24 fps (about five seconds) whenever
# the Web UI or an API request does not supply its own frames / fps value.
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model ./models/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B.gguf --backend ggml_cuda \
    --video-frames 121 --fps 24

# 121 frames at the TI2V-5B native area is 27k DiT tokens, and self-attention is
# quadratic in that, so a full 50-step run on the BASE checkpoint is hours on a
# laptop-class GPU (measured: ~3 h 30 m on an M5 Pro). Point --model at a
# step-distilled checkpoint instead and the identical request takes 17 m 30 s --
# nothing else changes. See "Video generation (Wan)" below.
# The server logs a per-pass timing plus a running ETA and heartbeats every 30 s,
# and the Web UI shows both; docs/models/wan.md has the full cost table.

# Configure server-wide default sampling parameters
# (used whenever a request does not override the value itself)
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model ./models/model.gguf --backend ggml_metal \
    --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.9 --top-k 40 --repeat-penalty 1.1 \
    --presence-penalty 0.0 --frequency-penalty 0.0 --seed 42 \
    --stop "</s>" --stop "<|endoftext|>"

# Read all of the above from a reusable JSON file (auto-downloads the model on
# first run). See the Configuration file section and config/ for examples.
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --config config/server-basic.json
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --config config/server-basic.json --backend ggml_cpu
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser — the root URL serves the chat UI (`GET /health` is the liveness endpoint). The web interface supports:

- Multi-turn chat conversations
- Per-tab chat sessions: each browser tab owns its own tracked conversation history; KV blocks are owned by the inference engine
- A single hosted GGUF selected explicitly with `--model`
- An explicit hosted multimodal projector via `--mmproj` when needed
- Full text and PDF document uploads, plus image, video, and audio uploads for multimodal inference (up to 500 MB)
- Thinking/reasoning mode toggle
- Tool calling with function definitions
- Streaming token generation via Server-Sent Events
- DiffusionGemma denoising previews when a `diffusion-gemma` GGUF is hosted (the UI replaces the whole assistant message on each denoising step, then emits the final answer)
- Backward-compatible queue-status events (the engine itself handles concurrency)
- Message editing and deletion with regeneration from any point in the conversation
- Free scrolling: scroll up to read earlier replies while new tokens stream in; the chat auto-scrolls again as soon as the user scrolls back to the bottom

Use `--model` to choose the hosted GGUF file and `--mmproj` to choose the hosted projector. `TensorSharp.Server` no longer scans a `MODEL_DIR`.

**Server command-line options:**

Running `TensorSharp.Server` with no arguments prints the full parameter reference (description, default, and an example per option) and exits; `--help` does the same. Pass `--model` at startup for inference. Other options can start a model-less status process, but `/api/models/load` cannot select a GGUF that was not supplied at startup.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--model <path>` | GGUF file to host (required for inference; when other options are passed without it, the server starts but `/api/models/load` will report no hosted model) |
| `--mmproj <path>` | Multimodal projector GGUF (resolved relative to the model directory when only a filename is given; pass `none` to disable). Requires `--model`. |
| `--backend <type>` | Default compute backend: `cpu`, `cuda`, `mlx`, `ggml_cpu`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan` |
| `--tp <N>` | Tensor parallelism degree — split the hosted model across N local GPUs (default: `1`). Requires `--backend cuda`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan`. Env: `TENSORSHARP_TP_DEGREE`. See [Tensor Parallelism & Distributed Inference](#tensor-parallelism--distributed-inference). |
| `--tp-node-id <N>` | This node's 0-based ID for multi-node (distributed) tensor parallelism. The server can only be node `0` (the driver that serves HTTP); start worker nodes with `TensorSharp.Cli`. Requires `--tp-peers`. Env: `TENSORSHARP_TP_NODE_ID`. |
| `--tp-peers <list>` | Comma-separated `host:port` list of all nodes in the distributed TP cluster, ordered by node ID (e.g. `192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500`). Requires `--tp-node-id`. Env: `TENSORSHARP_TP_PEERS`. |
| `--gpu-device <N>` | Vulkan device index for the `ggml_vulkan` backend on multi-GPU hosts (e.g. an integrated Intel GPU next to a discrete NVIDIA one). Defaults to device 0; use `--list-gpus` to see the indices. Also settable via the `TS_GGML_VULKAN_DEVICE` env var. |
| `--list-gpus` | List the Vulkan devices ggml-vulkan can see (index + adapter name) and exit |
| `--help` | Print the parameter reference (also shown when the server is started with no arguments) and exit |
| `--max-tokens <N>` | Maximum tokens to generate: fills in when a request omits its own limit, and caps a request that asks for more. Applies to every endpoint (Web UI, `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`). Default: `20000`, which is a plain default and does not cap. Env: `MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `--video-frames <N>` | Default output frame count for Wan video generation when a Web UI or API request omits `frames`. The VAE snaps it to `4k+1`; `121` frames at 24 fps is about five seconds. Without this flag, the model default is `33` (`49` for Wan 2.2 TI2V). An explicit request `frames` value overrides this default. |
| `--fps <N>` | Default playback frame rate for Wan MP4 output when a Web UI or API request omits `fps`. Without this flag, the model default is `16` fps (`24` for Wan 2.2 TI2V). An explicit request `fps` value overrides this default; changing only FPS changes playback speed rather than the generated frame count. |
| `--temperature <f>` | Sampling temperature (`0` = greedy) |
| `--top-k <N>` | Top-K filtering (`0` = disabled) |
| `--top-p <f>` | Nucleus sampling threshold (`1.0` = disabled) |
| `--min-p <f>` | Min-p filtering (`0` = disabled) |
| `--repeat-penalty <f>` | Repetition penalty (`1.0` = none) |
| `--presence-penalty <f>` | Presence penalty (`0` = disabled) |
| `--frequency-penalty <f>` | Frequency penalty (`0` = disabled) |
| `--seed <N>` | Random seed (`-1` = non-deterministic) |
| `--stop <string>` | Stop sequence (can be repeated). Under `--sampling-precedence config` a per-request `stop`/`stop_sequences` list is merged with these; under `request` it replaces them. |
| `--sampling-precedence <config\|request>` | Who wins when a request also carries a sampling parameter you set above. `config` (default) keeps your value — clients such as VS Code Copilot Chat hardcode `temperature`/`top_p` into every request and would otherwise silently override your configuration; parameters you did **not** set still come from the request. `request` restores client-always-wins. Env: `TENSORSHARP_SAMPLING_PRECEDENCE`. |
| `--n-cpu-moe <N>` / `-ncmoe <N>` | Keep the routed MoE weights of the first N layers in system RAM and run their FFN on the CPU (see **Mixture-of-Experts CPU offload** above). `all` offloads every layer. Default: 0 on every architecture, DeepSeek V4 and GLM 5.x included; a model that does not fit is refused at load with the number of layers that would make it fit. Env: `TS_N_CPU_MOE`. |
| `--cpu-moe` / `-cmoe` | Shorthand for `--n-cpu-moe all`. Default: off. Env: `TS_CPU_MOE`. |
| `--cpu-moe-threads <N>` | Worker threads for the host-side expert matmul. Default: half the usable CPU parallelism (`hardware_concurrency` clamped by the affinity mask and the cgroup CPU quota) on hosts with more than 8 cores. The server needs the other half for Kestrel, the scheduler and the accelerator submission threads; sizing this near the quota collapses throughput rather than degrading (20.7 tok/s at 64 threads vs 8.2 at 71 on a 95-CPU quota). Env: `TS_CPU_MOE_THREADS`. |
| `--kv-cache-dtype <type>` | KV cache precision for the hosted model: `f32`, `f16`, `q8_0`, or `q4_0` (quantized caches trade small numerical drift for memory; see the CLI table above for the tier trade-offs). Default: auto — the backend/model pick. Env: `KV_CACHE_DTYPE`. |
| `--continuous-batching` / `--no-continuous-batching` | Enable (default) or disable iteration-level paged-batching. When enabled the server admits / preempts sequences mid-batch and packs them into one forward pass on models that implement `IBatchedPagedModel`. `--no-continuous-batching` falls back to per-sequence KV-swap for every model. Alias: `--paged-batching` / `--no-paged-batching`. |
| `--prefill-chunk-size <N>` | Chunked-prefill granularity under contention — the maximum prefill tokens scheduled per step while other requests are running, so parallel decodes get frequent turns at the GPU (default: `1024`). Env: `TS_SCHED_PREFILL_CHUNK`. |
| `--mtp-spec` / `--no-mtp-spec` | Enable NextN/MTP speculative decoding (default off) on models that ship a multi-token-prediction draft head (Qwen 3.6's embedded NextN block, or a Gemma 4 `gemma4-assistant` draft loaded via `--mtp-draft-model`). Engages for solo (non-concurrent) sequences: the draft head proposes up to `--mtp-draft` tokens per step and the trunk verifies them in one batched forward, with the request's own sampler (penalties included) driving both drafting and verification, so output matches standard decode. Engaged automatically only where profitable: Qwen 3.6 reports its embedded NextN block profitable on every backend, while Gemma 4's separate draft head engages on the ggml backends and on the direct `cuda` backend only. CPU / GGML CPU / MLX serve standard decode. Env: `TS_MTP_SPEC`. |
| `--mtp-draft <N>` | Maximum tokens drafted per speculative step (default `8`). Env: `TS_MTP_DRAFT`. |
| `--mtp-pmin <f>` | Minimum draft confidence in `(0, 1]` for a drafted token to be kept; drafting stops at the first low-confidence token. Default: chosen per drafter kind — `0.75` for a per-token draft head (top-1 probability over its top-10 logits), `0.35` for a block drafter, where the gate is the CUMULATIVE prefix probability and so the same number means something far stricter. Env: `TS_MTP_PMIN`. |
| `--draft-model <path>` | Speculative-decoding draft model for architectures whose drafter ships as its own file: DeepSeek V4's DSpark support GGUF (see [DeepSeek V4](docs/models/deepseek4.md#dspark-speculative-decoding)) and Muse-Glimmer's DFlash drafter (see [Muse-Glimmer](docs/models/muse-glimmer.md#3-dflash-speculative-decoding), env `TS_MUSE_GLIMMER_DFLASH`). Either one drafts a whole block per step and the trunk verifies it in one batched forward, so greedy output is unchanged. Engages on every single-sequence CLI path — `--input`, `--multi-turn-jsonl` and `--interactive` — with `--backend cuda` or `--backend ggml_cuda`. On the CLI it needs a pure-argmax sampler (any temperature, top-k/p or repetition penalty turns it off, because the standalone decoder verifies with argmax). `TensorSharp.Server` accepts the same flag alongside `--mtp-spec`, where verification runs the request's own sampler and so composes with any sampling settings. Env: `TS_DSV4_DSPARK`. |
| `--spec-draft-n-max <N>` | Cap on tokens drafted per speculative block (default: the drafter's trained block size). |
| `--spec-draft-conf-min <p>` | Minimum cumulative acceptance probability (the product of the confidence head's per-position estimates) for a drafted position to be kept (default `0.35`). |
| `--mtp-draft-model <path>` | Path to a separate MTP draft GGUF for architectures whose draft head ships as its own file (Gemma 4's `gemma4-assistant`). The draft's hidden size must match the target (e.g. pair the 12B target with its 12B draft, not the 26B-A4B draft); a mismatched or incomplete draft fails fast at startup with a remediation hint. Ignored for Qwen 3.6, which embeds its NextN block in the trunk GGUF. Env: `TS_MTP_DRAFT_MODEL`. |
| `--paged-kv` / `--no-paged-kv` | Legacy compatibility flags for the removed per-session paged-KV manager. Current server KV state is engine-owned; use continuous-batching / `TS_SCHED_*` knobs for the engine. Aliases: `--paged-kv-cache` / `--no-paged-kv-cache`. |
| `--paged-kv-block-size <N>` | Legacy standalone paged-KV block size. The current server engine uses `TS_SCHED_BLOCK_SIZE`. |
| `--paged-kv-ram-mb <N>` | Legacy standalone paged-KV RAM-tier cap. |
| `--paged-kv-ssd-dir <dir>` | Legacy standalone paged-KV SSD cold-tier directory. |
| `--paged-kv-ssd-mb <N>` | Legacy standalone paged-KV SSD cap. |
| `--paged-kv-quant-bits <0\|4\|8>` | Legacy standalone paged-KV block quantization accepted by the server (`4`/`8` = symmetric). The runtime env var also accepts `2` for affine min+scale, and the CLI accepts `0\|2\|4\|8`. |
| `--redis-url <url>` | Redis connection string enabling both the shared KV cache tier and the Responses API store (e.g. `localhost:6379`). Sets both `TS_KV_CACHE_REDIS_URL` and `TS_RESPONSES_STORE_REDIS_URL`. |
| `--paged-kv-redis-url <url>` | Redis connection string for the shared KV cache tier only (e.g. `localhost:6379`). Env: `TS_KV_CACHE_REDIS_URL`. |
| `--paged-kv-redis-ttl <min>` | TTL in minutes for Redis KV cache entries; `0` = no TTL (default: `1440`, i.e. 24 hours). Env: `TS_KV_CACHE_REDIS_TTL_MINUTES`. |
| `--api-key <key>` | Require this API key on every request, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (what OpenAI SDKs do) or `X-Api-Key: <key>`. `GET /health` and the Web UI shell page stay open; every API route (Web UI calls included) returns `401` without the key. Default: no key — every route is anonymous, matching servers started before this option existed. Env: `TS_API_KEY`. |
| `--api-key-file <path>` | Read the API key from a file (surrounding whitespace trimmed), keeping it out of the process list and shell history. `--api-key` wins when both are given. |
| `--api-key-scope <all\|external>` | Which clients must present the key. `all` (default): every client, loopback included. `external`: only clients connecting from non-loopback addresses — local tools and the bundled Web UI keep working unkeyed while the LAN/internet-facing bind is protected. The check uses the TCP connection's remote address, so behind a reverse proxy every request looks loopback — use `all` there. Requires an API key. |

Per-request fields in the chat / generate JSON payloads (e.g. `temperature`,
`top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`,
`frequency_penalty`, `seed`, `stop`/`stop_sequences`) fill in every parameter
you did **not** configure above. For a parameter you *did* configure, the
default `--sampling-precedence config` keeps your value and ignores the
request's — many chat clients hardcode `temperature`/`top_p` into every call
with no way for the end user to change them, so an unconfigured server-side
value is the only one a request can move. Pass `--sampling-precedence request`
for the inverse (clients always win), which is what versions before this flag
did unconditionally.

**Runtime environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `BACKEND` | Default compute backend (`cpu`, `cuda`, `mlx`, `ggml_cpu`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan`), used when `--backend` is not passed (default: `ggml_metal` on macOS, `ggml_cpu` elsewhere) |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | Maximum generation length when `--max-tokens` is not passed: fills in when a request omits its own limit and caps a request that asks for more (default: `20000`, which is a plain default and does not cap) |
| `MAX_CONTEXT` | Context window to allocate, overriding the length the GGUF advertises. Set, it is a **hard limit**: honoured when the caches plus one full `n_ubatch` graph fit, refused with the numbers when they do not. Left unset, the advertised length is a **ceiling** — after the weights load, the runtime asks the devices how much VRAM is actually free, sizes the context to fit, and logs what it picked. GLM-5.2 advertises 1,048,576 tokens (~93 GiB of KV); on 3x RTX PRO 6000 the pick is 342,272 on the layer split, 91,136 with `--tp 3`, and 646,400 with `--n-cpu-moe 30` |
| `VIDEO_SAMPLE_FPS` | Frames sampled per second from an **input video prompt** for multimodal understanding; time-based extraction (default: `1`). This is unrelated to the Wan output setting `--fps`. |
| `VIDEO_MAX_FRAMES` | Optional upper bound on frames extracted from an **input video prompt** (evenly down-sampled); unset/`0` means no cap (default: no cap). This is unrelated to Wan output `--video-frames`. |
| `PORT` / `HOST` | Listen port / bind interface when `--port` / `--host` are not passed (defaults: `5000`, `0.0.0.0`) |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | Full listen URL(s) when none of `--port`, `--host`, `--urls`, `PORT`, or `HOST` is set |
| `TS_API_KEY` | API key required on requests when neither `--api-key` nor `--api-key-file` is passed (default: unset — every route stays anonymous) |
| `TENSORSHARP_TEMPERATURE` | Sampling temperature when `--temperature` is not passed. Counts as operator-configured, so it also outranks the request body under the default `--sampling-precedence config` |
| `TENSORSHARP_TOP_K` | Top-K when `--top-k` is not passed (same precedence rule as `TENSORSHARP_TEMPERATURE`) |
| `TENSORSHARP_TOP_P` | Top-P when `--top-p` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_MIN_P` | Min-P when `--min-p` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_REPEAT_PENALTY` | Repetition penalty when `--repeat-penalty` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_PRESENCE_PENALTY` | Presence penalty when `--presence-penalty` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_FREQUENCY_PENALTY` | Frequency penalty when `--frequency-penalty` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_SEED` | Random seed when `--seed` is not passed (same precedence rule) |
| `TENSORSHARP_SAMPLING_PRECEDENCE` | `config` (default) or `request`: whether server-configured sampling parameters outrank the ones a client sends. `--sampling-precedence` overrides it |
| `TENSORSHARP_LOG_LEVEL` | Minimum log level for both console and file loggers: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical` (default: `Information`). Also honored by `TensorSharp.Cli`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_LOG_DIR` | Directory the JSON-line file logger writes to (default: `<binDir>/logs`). Also honored by `TensorSharp.Cli`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_LOG_FILE` | Set to `0` to disable the file logger and keep only the console output (default: enabled). Also honored by `TensorSharp.Cli`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_DEGREE` | Tensor parallelism degree — number of local GPUs to split the model across (default: `1`). Fallback in `ModelBase.Create` when no `--tp` flag is passed; both `TensorSharp.Cli` and `TensorSharp.Server` expose it as `--tp <N>`. Requires `--backend cuda`, `ggml_cuda`, or `ggml_vulkan`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_DEVICES` | GPU ordinals the TP ranks map to, comma-separated (e.g. `0,2`; default `0..tp-1`). Used by TP on the GGML backends. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_NODE_ID` | This node's 0-based ID for multi-node distributed tensor parallelism. Must be set together with `TENSORSHARP_TP_PEERS`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_PEERS` | Comma-separated `host:port` list of all nodes in the distributed TP cluster (e.g. `192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500`). Must be set together with `TENSORSHARP_TP_NODE_ID`. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | How long each node keeps retrying outbound connections to its peers before giving up (default: `120`). Raise it when nodes are started far apart by hand or by a slow orchestrator. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_RECV_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Per-receive timeout for a blocking read from a peer (default: `300`). A stalled peer fails the collective instead of hanging on the OS TCP keepalive (often 2+ hours). |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_DISABLE_P2P` | Set to `1` to force every cross-GPU transfer through host staging instead of CUDA peer-to-peer DMA. Slower, but reproduces the code path taken by hardware without peer access (A16 vGPU profiles, some consumer cards) and isolates P2P-specific defects. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_HOST_ALLREDUCE` | Set to `1` to run the local AllReduce through host memory (device→host, sum, host→device) instead of the device-to-device P2P path. Diagnostic fallback that mirrors the known-good multi-node reduce. |
| `TS_KV_CACHE_REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string for the shared KV cache tier (e.g. `localhost:6379`). When set, KV cache blocks are persisted to Redis for cross-session reuse. CLI: `--redis-url` or `--paged-kv-redis-url`. |
| `TS_KV_CACHE_REDIS_TTL_MINUTES` | TTL in minutes for Redis KV cache entries; `0` = no TTL (default: `1440`). CLI: `--paged-kv-redis-ttl`. |
| `TS_RESPONSES_STORE_REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string for the OpenAI Responses API store. When set, `RedisResponsesStore` replaces the in-memory store. CLI: `--redis-url`. |
| `DIFFUSION_STEPS` | Server-side DiffusionGemma denoising steps per block (default: `48`; CLI equivalent is `--diffusion-steps`) |
| `DIFFUSION_MAX_BATCH` | Maximum concurrent DiffusionGemma requests batched by the Web UI diffusion scheduler (default: `2`) |

**Paged KV cache & continuous-batching tunables (read at process / model start)**

These can be set with either the `--paged-kv*` / `--continuous-batching` CLI flags (which translate to the env vars below) or directly via the environment:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TS_KV_PAGED_CACHE` | Legacy compatibility switch for the standalone `PagedKvCacheManager`; current `TensorSharp.Server` request KV state is engine-owned. The CLI shortcuts are `--paged-kv` / `--no-paged-kv`. |

| `TS_KV_CACHE_MAX_SSD_MB` | Legacy standalone paged-KV SSD cap. |
| `TS_KV_PAGED_QUANT_BITS` | Legacy standalone paged-KV block quantization bits (`0` = passthrough, `2` = affine, `4`, or `8`). |
| `TS_SCHED_DISABLE_BATCHED` | `1` forces the per-sequence KV-swap fallback even when a model implements `IBatchedPagedModel`. The CLI shortcut is `--no-continuous-batching`. |

| `TS_SCHED_SOLO_PREFILL_CHUNK` | Prefill chunk size for the fresh (start_pos = 0) part of a SOLO prompt — one uncontended request gets big fused-prefill chunks (default: `8192`). |
| `TS_SCHED_NUM_BLOCKS` | Physical blocks in the engine block pool (default: `256`). |
| `TS_SCHED_BLOCK_SIZE` | Tokens per block on the engine side (default: `256`). |

| `TS_SCHED_DECODE_QUANTUM` | Tokens before a sequence-switch is allowed (default: block size). |
| `TS_QWEN35_BATCHED` | Set to `0` to force the Qwen 3.5/3.6 family onto the legacy per-sequence KV-swap path (default: batched/paged). Also implicitly disabled by `--no-continuous-batching`. |

| `TS_PAGED_ATTN_KERNEL` | Paged-attention dispatch kernel for `Mistral3Model.BatchedForward`: `native` (default), `tensor` (C# Tensor-based), or `managed` (pure C# scalar). |
| `TS_MLX_PIPELINED_DECODE` | `1` (default) enables pipelined greedy decode on the MLX backend when the request is greedy, has no stop sequences, and the model supports device-side argmax / next-embedding lookup. Set to `0` to disable. CLI only. |
| `TS_MLX_MLOCK_GGUF` | `1` (default) pins the GGUF mmap region in physical RAM via `mlock(2)` so model weights stay resident between forward passes. Set to `0` to skip (use if the process `memlock` rlimit is too low or you want the OS to manage paging). MLX backend only. |
| `TS_MLX_FUSED_KV_WRITE` | `1` (default) uses a single multi-dim `slice_update` to write the per-token KV block. Set to `0` to revert to the per-head loop (A/B testing / regression isolation). |
| `TS_MLX_BATCHED_MOE_DECODE` | `1` (default) collapses K per-expert decode dispatches to one batched dispatch per (gate/up/down) kind for Qwen 3.5/3.6 MoE. Set to `0` on memory-constrained machines (saves ~weight-doubling overhead from the stacked weight slabs). |
| `TS_MLX_MOE_FUSED_GATE_UP_SILU` | `1` (default) fuses gate matmul + up matmul + SiLUMul into one Metal kernel for batched MoE decode. Set to `0` to A/B against the legacy 3-dispatch path. |
| `TS_MLX_DEVICE_ROUTER` | `1` (default) keeps MoE router top-K + softmax on device to skip ~60 host syncs/token on Qwen 3.6-35B-A3B. Set to `0` to disable; the code also falls back automatically when prerequisites are missing. |
| `TS_MLX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` / `TS_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_MB` / `TS_MLX_WIRED_LIMIT_MB` | Override the MLX allocator hard cap / unused-buffer cache cap / wired-buffer residency cap (megabytes). Defaults are derived from the host's unified-memory capacity. |
| `TS_MLX_EVAL_EVERY_N_LAYERS` / `TS_MLX_GEMMA4_EVAL_EVERY_N_LAYERS` | Periodic `mlx_async_eval` cadence during decode to overlap GPU work with host queueing. Gemma 4 defaults to every 4 layers via `TS_MLX_GEMMA4_EVAL_EVERY_N_LAYERS`; Qwen 3 / Qwen 3.5 / Nemotron-H default to every 16 layers via `TS_MLX_EVAL_EVERY_N_LAYERS`. Set to `0` to disable where supported. |
| `TENSORSHARP_MLX_LIBRARY` / `TENSORSHARP_MLX_LIBRARY_DIR` | Override the search path for `libmlxc` when using `--backend mlx`. |

**MTP / speculative-decoding tunables**

These gate the optional multi-token-prediction speculative decode path (see [MTP / NextN speculative decoding](FEATURES.md#mtp--nextn-speculative-decoding)). `TS_MTP_*` are the shared knobs (also set by the `--mtp-*` CLI flags); `TS_GMTP_*` are Gemma 4 draft-path A/B switches.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TS_MTP_SPEC` | `1` enables MTP/NextN speculative decoding for solo sequences (default `0`). CLI: `--mtp-spec` / `--no-mtp-spec`. |
| `TS_MTP_DRAFT` | Maximum tokens drafted per speculative step (default `8`). CLI: `--mtp-draft`. |
| `TS_MTP_PMIN` | Minimum draft confidence in `(0, 1]` to keep a drafted token (default: per drafter kind — `0.75` per-token, `0.35` block). CLI: `--mtp-pmin`. |
| `TS_MTP_DRAFT_MODEL` | Path to the separate Gemma 4 `gemma4-assistant` draft GGUF. CLI: `--mtp-draft-model`. Ignored by Qwen 3.6 (embedded NextN). |
| `TS_GMTP_NO_FUSED` | `1` disables the Gemma 4 fused multi-token-verify / draft-step GGML kernels and falls back to the per-op path (A/B testing on ggml backends). |
| `TS_GMTP_NO_FAST_ROLLBACK` | `1` restores the kept-prefix rollback path instead of the dense exact-match fast rollback used on partial draft acceptance. |
| `TS_GMTP_BATCHED_TRUNK` | `1` opts the Gemma 4 verify trunk back into the batched paged path; the default runs the faster linear trunk for solo speculation. |

**DiffusionGemma-specific tunables**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DIFFUSION_NO_SC` | Set to `1` to disable self-conditioning. Enabled by default. |
| `DIFFUSION_SC_TOPK` | Experimental self-conditioning top-K cutoff (default: `32`). |
| `DIFFUSION_NO_PKV` | Set to `1` to disable prompt-KV caching on device-glue backends. Enabled by default where supported. |
| `DIFFUSION_NO_FUSED_DECODE` | Set to `1` to disable the GGML fused model decode path and fall back to per-op / per-layer diffusion decode. |
| `DIFFUSION_NO_FUSED_LMHEAD_TAIL` | Set to `1` to disable the fused output-norm + lm-head + softcap tail. |
| `DIFFUSION_BATCHED_FORWARD` | Set to `1` to use true batched `DecodeCanvasBatched` for active diffusion canvases; default time-slices the faster fused single-canvas path. |
| `DIFFUSION_LMHEAD_BATCH_CAP_MB` | Memory cap for batched diffusion lm-head logits before falling back to per-sequence lm-head (default: `300`). |

Sampling parameter precedence (highest wins), with the default
`--sampling-precedence config`:

1. Server-wide CLI flags / config-file keys (e.g. `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--stop`).
2. `TENSORSHARP_*` environment variables listed above.
3. Per-request JSON fields in the API call (e.g. `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`)
   — for every parameter that steps 1 and 2 did not set.
4. Built-in `SamplingConfig` defaults (`temperature=0.8`, `top_k=40`, `top_p=0.9`, `min_p=0`, `repeat_penalty=1.1`, `repeat_last_n=64`, presence/frequency penalties `0`, `seed=-1`, no stop sequences).

With `--sampling-precedence request`, steps 1–3 swap: the request wins over the
server-wide flags and env vars for parameters it sends, and they still fill in
the rest. Either way `--stop` sequences pinned on the server stay in force under
`config` (merged with the request's) and are replaced by the request under
`request`.

## Video generation (Wan)

A `wan` GGUF turns a prompt — plus an optional first-frame image on the Wan 2.2
models — into an H.264 MP4, from `TensorSharp.Cli`, the server's three video
endpoints, and the Web UI chat. Full architecture detail is in the
[Wan card](docs/models/wan.md); this section is the operator's view: which
checkpoint to download, and which knobs actually change the wall clock.

### Which checkpoint

| Family | Latent | Modes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wan 2.2 TI2V-5B | 48 ch, 16×16×4 (`Wan2.2_VAE.safetensors`) | T2V + I2V | dense 5B, 24 fps, natively 720p; ~2.7× fewer DiT tokens than Wan 2.1 at the same resolution, so it is both the fastest and the highest-quality option on consumer GPUs |
| Wan 2.2 A14B (T2V / I2V) | 16 ch (36 ch I2V input), `wan_2.1_vae.safetensors` | T2V + I2V | two 14B experts switched at a timestep boundary; **both** expert GGUFs must be present (same folder, or `HighNoise/` + `LowNoise/`) |
| Wan 2.1 T2V (1.3B / 14B) | 16 ch, `wan_2.1_vae.safetensors` | T2V | single DiT |

Every family also needs the UMT5-XXL text encoder
(`umt5-xxl-encoder-Q8_0.gguf`) and the matching video VAE. All three companions
are resolved from the DiT's own directory, subfolders such as `VAE/`,
`HighNoise/` and `LowNoise/` included, so one `--local-dir` is enough;
`--wan-vae` / `--wan-te` (and `TS_WAN_DIT2` for the second A14B expert)
override the search.

Wan is the one family that rejects a backend outright: it runs on `ggml_cuda`,
`ggml_vulkan`, `ggml_metal`, `ggml_cpu`, `cuda` and `cpu`, and **not** on
`--backend mlx`. `ggml_cuda` is the fastest (RTX 2000 Ada, Wan2.1-1.3B F16,
832×480×33f, 30 steps: `ggml_cuda` 12.0 s/step vs `ggml_vulkan` 17.2 and direct
`cuda` 19.3); `cpu` / `ggml_cpu` are for functional use only.

### The fast lane: step-distilled checkpoints

**This is the single biggest speed lever in Wan, and it costs nothing but a
different download.** The official Wan2.2-TI2V-5B recipe is 50 steps × 2
classifier-free-guidance passes = **100 DiT passes**. A step-distilled
checkpoint (Turbo / Lightning / FastWan / DMD) is trained to run guidance-free
in a handful of steps, so the same video costs **4 DiT passes** — 1/25th of the
denoising work.

TensorSharp detects one from the DiT **file name**: any of `turbo`, `distill`,
`lightning`, `lightx2v`, `fastwan`, `-dmd` (case-insensitive), or an explicit
`<N>steps` / `<N>_steps` token for 1 ≤ N ≤ 16, which wins over the markers. A
marker with no step count means 4. On load the console prints

```
step-distilled checkpoint detected -> 4 steps, guidance off (--diffusion-steps / --cfg override)
```

so you can confirm from the log that it fired. No flag is involved — a distilled
GGUF is passed as an ordinary `--model`.

Measured on an M5 Pro (20-core GPU, 48 GB unified), `ggml_metal`,
Wan2.2-TI2V-5B Q8_0, 1088×832×121f = 27 404 tokens, image-to-video — i.e. the
full five-second 720p-class request:

| | Base checkpoint | **Turbo checkpoint** |
|---|---|---|
| DiT passes | 100 (50 steps × CFG) | **4** (4 steps, guidance-free) |
| per pass | 120.2 s | 120.2 s |
| denoise total | 12 020 s | **481 s** |
| VAE decode, 121 frames | 563 s | 563 s |
| **end to end** | **≈ 3 h 30 m** | **17 m 30 s** |

Only the `--model` path changes between those two columns. Once distilled, the
VAE decode is the bottleneck (~55% of the run), not the DiT.

Getting one (TI2V-5B — note the file names spell the version with an
**underscore**, `Wan2_2`, unlike the base repo):

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf download hum-ma/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Turbo-GGUF Wan2_2-TI2V-5B-Turbo-Q8_0.gguf --local-dir models
# the Turbo repo ships no VAE and no text encoder — take them from the base repos
hf download QuantStack/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-GGUF VAE/Wan2.2_VAE.safetensors --local-dir models
hf download city96/umt5-xxl-encoder-gguf umt5-xxl-encoder-Q8_0.gguf --local-dir models

dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model models/Wan2_2-TI2V-5B-Turbo-Q8_0.gguf \
    --backend ggml_metal --image first_frame.png --output out.mp4 \
    --prompt "the cat runs toward the camera, cinematic tracking shot" \
    --video-frames 121 --fps 24

dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model models/Wan2_2-TI2V-5B-Turbo-Q8_0.gguf \
    --backend ggml_metal --video-frames 121 --fps 24
```

For Wan 2.2 I2V-A14B the drop-in distilled GGUFs are
[jayn7/WAN2.2-I2V_A14B-DISTILL-LIGHTX2V-4STEP-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/jayn7/WAN2.2-I2V_A14B-DISTILL-LIGHTX2V-4STEP-GGUF),
which ships the distillation already merged into both experts under `high_noise/`
and `low_noise/`; download both and point `--model` at either one. It ships no
VAE and no text encoder, so take `VAE/Wan2.1_VAE.safetensors` from
[QuantStack/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/QuantStack/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-GGUF)
and the UMT5-XXL encoder as above.

> [lightx2v/Wan2.2-Lightning](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Wan2.2-Lightning)
> publishes LoRA `.safetensors` only, and TensorSharp has no Wan LoRA option —
> use a repo that ships the distillation already baked into the GGUF.

### `--cfg-cache-stride` (base checkpoints only)

A guided step is `v = v_cond + (cfg-1)·d` with `d = v_cond - v_uncond`. The
guidance direction `d` changes far more slowly across the schedule than `v`
does, so `--cfg-cache-stride N` runs the unconditional pass on one step in `N`
and reuses the cached `d` in between. At 50 steps, `2` runs 77 of the 100 passes
(**1.30×**) and `3` runs 70 (**1.43×**). The first three steps and the last
always recompute `d`. Server JSON field: `"cfgCacheStride": 2`.

It is an approximation — leave it off when matching a reference sample matters —
and it is pointless on a step-distilled checkpoint, which already runs
guidance-free (the cache is disabled whenever cfg ≤ 1.0).

### Making a large request cheaper, in order of effect

1. **Use a step-distilled checkpoint.** 100 DiT passes become 4; this dwarfs
   everything else.
2. **Fewer frames.** 121 → 61 roughly quarters the attention work (token count
   is `latent_frames × (h/2) × (w/2)` and self-attention is `O(tokens²)`) and
   halves the VAE decode.
3. **Smaller frame area** — but not below Wan's training resolutions. Under
   ~0.3 MP the model is out of distribution and the video gets *worse*, not just
   cheaper; the pipeline warns below that. Wan is trained at 480p (832×480) and
   720p (1280×704), so generate at a supported size and downscale afterwards.
4. **Fewer steps**, base checkpoints only — 30 instead of the official 50 is
   visibly close and 1.7× cheaper.
5. **`--cfg-cache-stride 2` or `3`** — 1.30× / 1.43×, base checkpoints only.

Resolution against wall clock on the same M5 Pro, same Turbo checkpoint and
image:

| Output | Tokens | Denoise | VAE decode | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 736×544 × 81f (3.4 s, 480p class) | 8 211 | 84 s | 159 s | **4 m 09 s** |
| 736×544 × 121f (5 s, 480p class) | 12 121 | 137 s | 237 s | **6 m 19 s** |
| 1088×832 × 121f (5 s, 720p class) | 27 404 | 481 s | 563 s | **17 m 30 s** |

480p (≈0.4 MP) is a resolution Wan is *trained* at, so the first two rows are
in-distribution rather than a degraded mode — that is the setting to reach for
when a few minutes matters.

### Server defaults

`--video-frames N` and `--fps N` set server-wide **defaults**, not caps, for the
Web UI and all three video endpoints; a request that supplies `frames` or `fps`
overrides each independently. With both omitted the model recipe applies: 49
frames at 24 fps for Wan2.2-TI2V, 33 at 16 fps otherwise. Frame counts are
snapped to the VAE's `4k+1` temporal grid. Keep the model's native FPS and change
the frame count to change duration — changing only FPS changes playback speed.

### Other Wan knobs

These exist for A/B and debugging; all of them make things slower except where
noted. `TS_WAN_DIT_KV_F16=0` restores F32 attention keys/values (F16 is the
default and is 2.02× faster on a single 27 k-token self-attention, with no
measurable accuracy cost);
`TS_WAN_VAE_MPS_CONV=0` restores ggml's im2col+GEMM conv lowering on Metal
(MPSGraph is the default and took a 736×544×81f VAE decode from 159 s to 80 s);
`TS_WAN_VAE_GEMM_MAX_MB` sets the im2col budget and `TS_WAN_VAE_TILE=0` disables
tiling; `TS_WAN_DIT_CAPTURE=0` disables the persistent CUDA-graph-captured DiT
graph; `TS_WAN_DIT_FLASH=0` forces materialized attention;
`TS_WAN_HEARTBEAT_S` sets the progress tick interval (default 30 s, `0`
silences it); `TS_FFMPEG` points at the `ffmpeg` used for near-lossless CRF 17
H.264 export.

## Mixture-of-Experts CPU offload (`--n-cpu-moe`)

Large MoE models spend almost all of their bytes on routed experts while
activating only a small fraction of them per token — Qwen3.6-35B-A3B is ~11 GB
of weights for ~3B active parameters. `--n-cpu-moe N` keeps the routed experts
of the first N layers in system RAM, leaving attention, the norms, the router
and the always-active shared expert on the accelerator. `--n-cpu-moe` therefore
means "these experts do not live in VRAM" — not "these experts are multiplied on
the CPU". Where they are multiplied depends on the batch:

* **Decode (one token, or any batch under `TS_HOST_MOE_DEVICE_MIN_BATCH`, default
  128).** The host multiplies them, reading the quantized blocks zero-copy out of
  the GGUF mmap. One token only touches `n_expert_used` experts, so this is a few
  MB of RAM traffic per layer against the hundreds of MB an upload would cost.
* **Prefill (a real batch).** The experts are *streamed* to the accelerator for
  that one graph and multiplied there, then the staging memory is reused by the
  next layer — they are never made resident. A 512-token batch amortizes the
  upload over every token in it, and the arithmetic is what the GPU is for.
  llama.cpp's scheduler makes the same call (`ggml_backend_sched` sends an op
  whose weights live in a host buffer back to the GPU above
  `op_offload_min_batch_size`).

Three things make the streamed side fast, and they are why TensorSharp's
offloaded prefill runs several times faster than llama.cpp's on the same files:

1. **The host pages are locked.** A copy out of a pageable mmap cannot DMA — the
   driver stages it through a small pinned buffer. `cudaHostRegister` on the
   expert range costs ~65 ms/GiB once and takes the transfer from 9.3 GB/s to
   55.6 GB/s on PCIe 5.0 x16. Disable with `TS_HOST_MOE_PIN=0`; bound it with
   `TS_HOST_MOE_PIN_MAX_MB` (default: 60% of the cgroup/host memory limit).
2. **Only the experts this batch routes to are sent**, grouped into consecutive
   runs — the same trick llama.cpp's scheduler plays with its used-expert bitset.
   At 512 tokens a large expert pool is only partly covered, and at the small
   batches speculative verification and light serving produce it is a large
   saving. `TS_HOST_MOE_EXPERT_FILTER=0` restores whole-stack uploads.
3. **The copies are issued asynchronously** on the backend's own stream and
   synchronize once, with the graph, instead of three times per layer.

The offloaded layers stay inside the fused whole-model graph: the accelerator
pauses after each offloaded layer's router, the experts are multiplied (on the
host, or on the accelerator from streamed weights), and the result is handed back
before the next segment runs. Everything else in the token — attention, the
shared or dense FFN, the LM head — stays in one graph submission. This holds for
Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma 4 MoE, GPT-OSS and DiffusionGemma; Gemma 4 MoE segments its
prefill graph the same way, and DiffusionGemma's block decode hands the host all
of the canvas positions at once so its offloaded side is a GEMM rather than a
matvec. Qwen3.5/3.6 segments its prefill graph the same way, and both it and
Gemma 4 MoE keep the fused graph under tensor parallelism too (see the `--tp`
note below). GPT-OSS now has a fused whole-model prefill graph as well, so its
offloaded prefill is segmented rather than dispatched per layer. Architectures
that still lack one (Nemotron-H) reach the streamed path through their per-layer
MoE op, on a single device; under `--tp N` they stay host-side so that N ranks do
not each stream their own copy of the same unsharded experts.

Measured on 2 x Xeon 6952P + RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (PCIe 5.0 x16), **pp8192 /
tg128**, peak per-process VRAM. The full comparison against llama.cpp — two prompt
lengths, five offload depths per model, including DeepSeek V4 Flash across two
GPUs — is in

At every offload depth that is **4.5-10.9x** llama.cpp's prefill and **2.5-4.5x**
its decode on the three seam models. Peak VRAM is higher than llama.cpp's (1.1x
resident, up to 3.5x fully offloaded) — see the report's VRAM note.

Greedy output is **token-identical** at every offload depth on gemma-4-26B-A4B.

A small-machine picture from the same feature on a laptop (RTX 3080 Laptop
16 GB / i7-11800H, 96-token generation) — note how far under the card's 16 GB
the offloaded configurations sit, and that both the GPT-OSS and DiffusionGemma
baselines were over the WDDM spill threshold, which is why offload makes them
*faster* as well as smaller there:

| Model | Setting | Peak VRAM | Prefill | Decode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gemma-4-26B-A4B (Q4_K_XL) | default | 16.1 GB | 190 tok/s | 39.7 tok/s |
| | `--n-cpu-moe 8` | 13.1 GB | 52 tok/s | 38.6 tok/s |
| | `--n-cpu-moe 16` | 10.2 GB | 24 tok/s | 21.6 tok/s |
| | `--cpu-moe` (30 layers) | 4.8 GB | 15 tok/s | 17.7 tok/s |
| gpt-oss-20b (Q8_0) | default | 16.2 GB | 2.7 tok/s | 0.3 tok/s |
| | `--n-cpu-moe 12` | 14.0 GB | 58 tok/s | 25.4 tok/s |
| | `--cpu-moe` (24 layers) | 2.9 GB | 29 tok/s | 12.1 tok/s |
| diffusiongemma-26B-A4B (Q4_K_M) | default | 16.0 GB | — | 1709 ms/step |
| | `--n-cpu-moe 16` | 9.8 GB | — | 2287 ms/step |
| | `--cpu-moe` (30 layers) | 3.0 GB | — | 4697 ms/step |

(Those laptop prefill numbers predate the streamed-expert path; the same
configurations are several times faster now.)

Notes:

* **Pick the smallest N that fits.** Each offloaded layer costs decode
  throughput, so offload only as many layers as you need to free the VRAM the
  KV cache wants.
* **Decode pays the most, proportionally.** Prompt processing streams the
  experts to the accelerator and stays within a small factor of the resident
  run; decode is bounded by how fast the host can read `n_expert_used` experts
  per layer out of RAM, which is where the throughput goes.
* **The worker count is capped at 64.** The decode-side matmul is one token
  wide — memory-bound work with a barrier after every op — so past a few dozen
  threads each extra worker only adds a barrier participant, and on a 2-socket
  host it adds cross-socket traffic too. Measured on 2x Xeon 6952P
  (192 cores / 384 threads), gemma-4-26B `--cpu-moe`, ms of host matmul per 30
  offloaded layers: 8 threads 45, 16 threads 35, 32 threads 17.6, 64 threads
  17.3, 96 threads 26, 192 threads 120. `--cpu-moe-threads N` overrides.
* **Routing stays on the accelerator**, so expert selection and weights are the
  same ones the fully resident path would pick.
* **The fused whole-model graph is kept.** Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma 4 MoE, GPT-OSS and
  DiffusionGemma each run a whole token (for DiffusionGemma, a whole canvas
  block) as ONE accelerator graph, and offload does not give that up. Each
  offloaded layer's expert matmuls are cut out of the graph; everything else —
  attention, norms, the router, the shared/dense FFN and the LM head — keeps
  running fused, with the accelerator pausing only to hand the host that layer's
  routed-expert work. Gemma 4 MoE segments its *prefill* graph the same way, so a
  prompt chunk is still one dispatch with the host doing a real GEMM over every
  token in it.
* Nemotron-H has no whole-model fused graph to preserve — its hybrid
  Mamba2/attention/MoE decode is dispatched per layer regardless — so offload
  there simply routes each layer's MoE through the host path.
* **Combines with tensor parallelism.** Under `--tp N` the offloaded layers'
  seams are merged into the same segment schedule the ranks already use for
  their AllReduce points, so the fused multi-rank graph is kept — Qwen3.5/3.6
  and Gemma 4 MoE run both decode and prefill fused. Each offloaded layer is
  evaluated ONCE, on the host, over the unsharded expert stack: the host expert
  backend is a single thread pool, so splitting that matmul per rank would only
  serialize on it while paying an extra download each. The single result is then
  placed so the graph's own reduction lands on the single-GPU value (rank 0 only
  where the layer output feeds a later AllReduce, every rank where it does not).
  Measured on 2x L4 24 GB (short prompt, prefill 512 / decode 64):

  | Model | Setting | Resident weights (GPU0 + GPU1) | Prefill | Decode |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (UD-IQ4_XS) | `--tp 2` | 9397 + 8032 MB | 1942 tok/s | 76.5 tok/s |
  | | `--tp 2 --cpu-moe` | 2277 + 912 MB | 66 tok/s | 17.8 tok/s |
  | gemma-4-26B-A4B (UD-IQ4_XS) | `--tp 2` | 6835 + 6087 MB | 3062 tok/s | 59.7 tok/s |
  | | `--tp 2 --n-cpu-moe 8` | 5459 + 4711 MB | 217 tok/s | 36.5 tok/s |
  | | `--tp 2 --cpu-moe` | 1588 + 840 MB | 60 tok/s | 13.2 tok/s |

  Greedy output on Gemma 4 is byte-identical to the same `--tp N` run without
  offload on most prompts and, on the rest, agrees for hundreds of characters
  before taking an equivalent alternative ending; Qwen3.5 likewise tracks the
  resident run to a paraphrase point. Both are deterministic — the gap is the
  host expert matmul's activation quantization, the same ~1-5% relative
  difference `TS_HOST_MOE_VERIFY=1` reports on a single GPU. The pure-C# `cuda`
  backend has no host-MoE seam, so `--tp N --cpu-moe` there prints the
  `[moe-offload] WARNING` and keeps the experts resident.
* **GLM 5.x serves its offloaded experts straight from the mapping.** The native
  glm-dsa executor keeps host-resident routed experts in the GGUF mmap and
  multiplies them in place instead of copying them into a private buffer
  (`TS_GLM_MOE_MMAP=0` copies instead), which is what makes offloading 30 of a
  744B model's layers a load-time no-op rather than a 100 GB memcpy. It composes
  with `--tp`: offloaded layers keep their experts whole and rank 0 evaluates
  them. Measured on 3x RTX PRO 6000, GLM-5.2 UD-IQ2_XXS, prefill 2048 /
  decode 64: `--n-cpu-moe 30` is 94.7 / 16.4 tok/s against 915.9 / 43.9 fully
  resident. Offload buys the fit here, not the speed — it frees enough VRAM to
  raise the sized context from 342,272 to 646,400 tokens.
* `TS_HOST_MOE_VERIFY=1` builds the on-GPU expert chain alongside the host one
  and reports their per-layer divergence — a diagnostic for validating the seam
  on a model that also fits in VRAM. `TS_HOST_MOE_DEBUG=1` prints the segment
  plan (the node cuts) and each seam's activation norms. `TS_HOST_MOE_TIMING=1`
  reports the offloaded side's wall clock split into per-call setup and host
  matmul, which is what tells you whether a slow run is the expert GEMM or the
  scaffolding around it.

## Tensor Parallelism & Distributed Inference

TensorSharp supports **tensor parallelism (TP)** — splitting a single model across
multiple GPUs using the Megatron-LM column/row-parallel pattern — and
**distributed (multi-node) tensor parallelism**, where TP spans multiple
machines connected over a TCP peer-to-peer network.

### TP vs. the layer split — what happens on a multi-GPU box

There are two different ways a model can occupy more than one GPU, and only one
of them is `--tp`.

**Tensor parallelism (`--tp N`)** puts *every* layer on *every* rank and splits
the weights *within* each layer, so a decode step reads `1/N` of the bytes per
device and the ranks all-reduce at each layer boundary. Every architecture in the
table below marked ✅ supports it, and it is **opt-in** — nothing splits a tensor unless
you ask.

**The layer split** puts *whole layers* on different devices and runs them in
sequence — device 0 evaluates layers 0..k, hands the hidden state to device 1,
and so on. The cut points are not a naive `n_layer/N`: the loader measures each
device's free VRAM and bin-packs the layers to balance the largest
fraction-of-budget used, so an uneven set of cards still fills up evenly. There
are no collectives and no per-layer split, so it costs nothing on a slow
interconnect, but only one GPU is busy at a time. This applies to
exactly **two architectures — DeepSeek V4 Flash (`deepseek4`) and GLM 5.x
(`glm-dsa`)** — because they are the two that run through their own whole-model
executors, and it is what they do **by default, with no flag at all**: they spread
across every visible GPU because neither fits on one card. `TS_DSV4_NGPU` and
`TS_GLM_NGPU` cap how many devices they use.

On **every other architecture**, running without `--tp` uses a **single GPU**.
There is no automatic layer split on the generic per-op or fused-graph paths — a
model that does not fit one card fails at load rather than being spread silently.
(The refusal that names the exact `--n-cpu-moe N` you would need comes from the
DeepSeek V4 and GLM 5.x whole-model loaders.)

So on a 3-GPU box, `--backend ggml_cuda` alone gives you all three GPUs on GLM 5.x
and DeepSeek V4 (layer split) and one GPU on Gemma 4; adding `--tp 3` switches the
GLM 5.x to tensor parallelism, caps DeepSeek V4's layer split at three devices
(there `--tp N` is only a device count — the same thing `TS_DSV4_NGPU` sets), and
gives Gemma 4 all three GPUs. On GLM 5.x that
switch is a downgrade in speed and buys only capacity — see the **What to
expect** measurements below.

### Local tensor parallelism (single process, multiple GPUs)

Split the model across N GPUs within one process (direct CUDA, or the GGML CUDA / Vulkan backends). Each GPU holds `1/N` of
the sharded weights (column-parallel QKV/gate/up, row-parallel output/down) plus
a full copy of replicated weights (norms, embeddings, LM head). Per-GPU KV
caches are independent; AllReduce (via CUDA P2P copies + elementwise-add kernel)
reconverges the hidden state after each row-parallel projection.

```bash
# CLI: 2-GPU tensor parallelism
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda --tp 2

# Server: same flag (TENSORSHARP_TP_DEGREE=2 env var also works)
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll \
    --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda --tp 2

# Config JSON
{ "tp": 2, "backend": "cuda", "model": "<model.gguf>" }
```

### Distributed tensor parallelism (multi-node, peer-to-peer TCP)

Distribute TP across multiple machines. Each node runs its own process with its
own local GPUs; nodes communicate over a TCP mesh using a length-prefixed
framing protocol. AllReduce is hierarchical: local P2P within each node, then
TCP across node representatives, then broadcast back — minimizing network
traffic to `1/tp_local` of the data per collective.

```bash
# 2 nodes × 2 GPUs each (4 GPUs total)
# Node 0:
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda --tp 2 \
    --tp-node-id 0 --tp-peers "192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500"

# Node 1:
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda --tp 2 \
    --tp-node-id 1 --tp-peers "192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500"

# Server as the cluster front-end: the server must be node 0 (the driver that
# owns sampling and serves HTTP); every other node runs a TensorSharp.Cli worker
# with the same model, backend, and peer list. The TENSORSHARP_TP_* env vars
# work as well.
# Node 0 (server / driver):
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda \
    --tp 2 --tp-node-id 0 --tp-peers "192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500"

# Node 1 (CLI worker):
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda \
    --tp 2 --tp-node-id 1 --tp-peers "192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500"

# Config JSON (per node)
{ "tp": 2, "tp-node-id": 0, "tp-peers": "192.168.1.10:9500,192.168.1.11:9500", "backend": "cuda" }
```

Every node must use the same `--tp-peers` list (or `TENSORSHARP_TP_PEERS` env
var) and a unique `--tp-node-id` (or `TENSORSHARP_TP_NODE_ID`). The port
(`9500` in the examples) is not a default — it must be specified explicitly and
must be reachable between all nodes.

### Supported architectures

| Architecture | TP status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen 3 | ✅ | Reference implementation |
| Mistral 3 | ✅ | Fused/separate QKV, YaRN RoPE |
| Gemma 3 | ✅ | Separate Q/K/V, GELU, sliding window |
| Gemma 4 | ✅ | Dense TP + MoE. On GGML the fused whole-model MoE trunk splits *inside* each expert (gate/up column-parallel, down row-parallel) so global expert ids keep working; `TS_GEMMA4_TP_FUSED_MOE=0` falls back to the whole-expert per-op path. Per-expert slicing on direct CUDA |
| Qwen 3.5 / 3.6 family | ✅ | GatedDeltaNet SSM with per-rank V-head ownership; expert-parallel MoE on GGML (whole experts per rank, Megatron-split shared expert), expert slicing on direct CUDA. Runs on both `cuda` and `ggml_cuda` / `ggml_vulkan` — the GGML path uses the packed per-rank GDN kernel (`TSGgml_Qwen35GdnLayerTP`) with device-resident recurrent state |
| GPT OSS | ✅ | Attention sinks, YaRN. Runs on `cuda` and the GGML backends; the GGML path is expert-parallel (whole experts per rank, one batched `ggml_mul_mat_id` dispatch per projection per layer) and falls back to per-expert slicing only when the expert count does not divide the TP degree |
| Nemotron-H | ✅ | Mamba2 replicated on rank 0, MoE expert slicing. Still walks experts per token per rank on GGML (no expert parallelism yet) |
| GLM 5.x | ✅ | MLA heads column-parallel (`attn_q_b` / `attn_k_b` / `attn_v_b`) with row-parallel `attn_output`; the 256 routed experts are split **row-wise inside every expert** (column-parallel gate/up, row-parallel down) rather than by expert id, because `ggml_mul_mat_id` needs a token's selected expert ids to stay distinct. Router, norms, the DSA indexer, the shared expert and the 3 dense layers are replicated; two all-reduces per layer. `TS_GLM_TP_SHARD` picks the halves (1 heads, 2 experts, 3 both), `TS_GLM_TP_OVERSUBSCRIBE=1` packs several ranks on one GPU for testing. GGML backends only |
| DiffusionGemma | — | Not applicable (diffusion model) |
| Qwen-Image-Edit | — | Not applicable (image generation) |

### Backend support

TP runs on the **direct CUDA** backend (`--backend cuda`) and on the **GGML
CUDA / Vulkan** backends (`--backend ggml_cuda`, `ggml_vulkan`). MLX is
single-device.

On the GGML backends each rank gets its own ggml backend on its own GPU, with
its own device-resident weight shards and KV cache. Cross-GPU AllReduce uses
ggml-cuda's collective (NCCL when the build finds it, its P2P pipeline
otherwise); small payloads are reduced in host memory instead, which is cheaper
because GGML activations already live there.

```bash
# 2 GPUs on the GGML CUDA backend
dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend ggml_cuda --tp 2

# Choose which physical GPUs the ranks map to
TENSORSHARP_TP_DEVICES=0,2 dotnet TensorSharp.Cli/bin/TensorSharp.Cli.dll \
    --model <model.gguf> --backend ggml_cuda --tp 2
```

**What to expect.** GGML TP started as a *capacity* feature — it lets a model
that does not fit in one GPU's VRAM run entirely on GPUs — and fused per-rank
execution (Stage 1c) made it a latency win as well. Each TP block now runs as a
per-rank fused native graph (attention, dense FFN, MoE trunk, GatedDeltaNet)
instead of op-at-a-time, so a rank issues a handful of graph launches per layer
rather than hundreds of native calls.

Measured on 2× RTX 2000 Ada (16 GB each, PCIe, no NVLink), prefill 512 /
decode 64, tok/s:

| Model | 1 GPU | `--tp 2` |
|---|---|---|
| Gemma 4 E4B Q8_0 | 2760 / 37.3 | 2488 / **51.7** |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B IQ4_XS | 1845 / 48.5 | 2537 / **51.2** |
| Qwen 3.5-9B Q8_0 | 1461 / 23.1 | 399 / **24.4** |
| Qwen 3.5-35B-A3B IQ4_XS | does not fit | **184 / 18.1** |

Decode — the memory-bound half TP should help — is 1.39× a single GPU on
Gemma 4 E4B and 1.06× on Qwen 3.5-9B; both Gemma 4 models produce output
byte-identical to their single-GPU runs. Prefill is compute-bound and pays the
collectives, so it lands at or below the single-GPU figure on models that fit on
one card. Qwen 3.5-35B does not fit a 16 GB card at all, so TP is the only way
to run it. See `TENSOR_PARALLELISM_PLAN.md` (Stages 1b and 1c) for the full
measurements and what is left to fuse.

How much TP buys depends on the interconnect and on how much of the layer it can
actually split. On GLM-5.2 (3x RTX PRO 6000, PCIe, no NVLink) it buys nothing:
`--tp 3` measures pp2048 505.6 / tg64 17.6 against 915.9 / 43.9 on the plain
layer split, because each of the 78 layers needs two all-reduces of a
`[6144, n_tokens]` hidden state and that costs more bus time than the split saves
in arithmetic. It also holds a full-length cache on *every* rank, which drops the
fitted context from 342,272 to 91,136 tokens, and it changes the reduction order,
so against the recorded llama.cpp goldens a 2-bit MoE reproduces 3 of 6 prompts
under `--tp 3` where the layer split reproduces 5 of 6.
Reach for it there on an NVLink host, or when a model fits no other way.

TP composes with MoE CPU offload: `--tp N --n-cpu-moe M` keeps the fused
multi-rank graph and drops the offloaded layers' expert bytes from every rank's
VRAM. See [Mixture-of-Experts CPU offload](#mixture-of-experts-cpu-offload---n-cpu-moe)
for the combined numbers.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_DEVICES` | GPU ordinals per rank, e.g. `0,2` (default `0..tp-1`) |
| `TS_GGML_TP_PARALLEL=0` | Drive ranks sequentially instead of concurrently (diagnostic) |
| `TS_GGML_TP_FUSED_MATMUL=1` | Submit both ranks' linears from one thread (off by default; it allocates a device buffer per rank per call, measured 2.3× slower on Qwen 3.5 35B) |
| `TS_GGML_TP_DEVICE_AR_THRESHOLD` | Element count above which AllReduce uses the device collective (default 262144) |
| `TS_GGML_F32_RESIDENT=0` | Bind F32 linear weights per call instead of keeping them device-resident (diagnostic) |
| `TS_GEMMA4_TP_FUSED_MOE=0` | Gemma 4 only: fall back from the fused whole-model MoE trunk (Megatron split inside each expert) to the whole-expert per-op path. The fused path materializes ~10.5 GB of expert slices at load on the 26B (~36 s) in exchange for a ~10× decode. Layers offloaded by `--n-cpu-moe` are skipped by that materialization — they never run on the accelerator — so `--cpu-moe` also removes the load-time cost |
| `GGML_CUDA_AR_BF16_THRESHOLD` | Payload size above which ggml-cuda's collective converts F32 to BF16 before reducing. TensorSharp raises ggml's default (1 byte — i.e. always) to 1 MB so decode-sized collectives reduce exactly; `0` disables the conversion entirely |
| `TS_QWEN35_LAYER_TRACE=1` | Print a per-layer residual-stream summary for the first forward, from both the single-GPU and TP loops (diagnostic) |
| `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE` | `nccl` / `internal` / `none`, passed through to ggml |

### Constraints

- `numHeads`, `numKVHeads`, and `intermediateSize` must be divisible by the TP degree.
- Quantized row-parallel splits require `ne0` divisible by `tp × blockSize`.
- Batched/continuous-batching forward under TP is implemented for Qwen 3 and Mistral 3; MoE models (Gemma 4, Qwen 3.5/3.6, GPT OSS, Nemotron-H) fall back to per-sequence forward under TP.
- **Muse-Glimmer** caps at `--tp 2`: it has 2 KV heads, and no model here replicates KV heads when `numKVHeads < tp`. Its DFlash drafter and pooled KV-block snapshots stay single-GPU under TP (multi-turn reuse comes from live-cache continuation instead), and it requires the GGML CUDA/Vulkan backends — the fused per-rank plan needs a device collective that ggml-metal does not provide.

### Cluster tuning & diagnostics

Local AllReduce prefers CUDA peer-to-peer DMA. At startup the group enables peer
access for every device pair that reports it, then runs a round-trip self-test:
some topologies (L4 behind certain PCIe switches, IOMMU-enabled hosts, small
BAR1 windows) advertise peer access but silently transfer corrupt data, and any
pair that fails the test is demoted to host staging permanently. Hardware
without peer access at all (A16 vGPU profiles, most consumer cards) simply
stages through host memory from the start.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_DISABLE_P2P=1` | off | Force every cross-GPU transfer through host memory, exactly as no-peer hardware does. Use it to check whether a multi-GPU defect lives in the P2P DMA path. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_HOST_ALLREDUCE=1` | off | Run the local AllReduce as device→host, sum on the CPU, host→device. Slower, but matches the multi-node reduce exactly — useful for isolating P2P correctness issues. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=N` | `120` | How long a node retries outbound connections to its peers. Nodes are usually launched by hand seconds or minutes apart, so a peer's listener may not be up yet; raise this for slow orchestrators. |
| `TENSORSHARP_TP_RECV_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=N` | `300` | Per-receive timeout on a peer socket. Without it a stalled peer would block on the OS TCP keepalive (often 2+ hours) instead of failing the collective. |

Startup logs make the topology explicit: the local group prints
`Tensor parallelism: N GPUs (<device names>)`, P2P demotions print a
`TP: P2P disabled…` / self-test warning, and every distributed node prints
`[TcpCommunicator] Rank r/N connected to all peers.` once the mesh is complete.

### Redis-backed shared state

The server can optionally persist KV cache blocks and the OpenAI Responses API
store to Redis, enabling cross-session KV reuse and durable response storage:

```bash
# Enable Redis for both KV cache and Responses API
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda \
    --redis-url localhost:6379

# KV cache tier only, with a 12-hour TTL
dotnet TensorSharp.Server/bin/TensorSharp.Server.dll --model <model.gguf> --backend cuda \
    --paged-kv-redis-url localhost:6379 --paged-kv-redis-ttl 720
```

## Feature × environment variable matrix

Quick reference for which environment variables (and matching CLI flags) gate each major feature. Variables in **bold** are required to turn the feature on; everything else is a tunable for a feature that's already enabled by default.

| GLM 5.x | not implemented — concurrency runs on native per-sequence **slots** instead (each request owns its MLA and indexer caches and its own `n_past`; binding a request switches the active slot without moving KV bytes). MLA keeps one 576-wide row per token and the DSA indexer scores that same contiguous history, so there is no paged-KV layout to batch over | — | `TS_BATCHED_FUSED_DECODE=1` enables a batched fused decode over those slots (one graph, one token per sequence, weights read once): 1.81x aggregate decode at 4 concurrent requests. Off by default because batching changes GEMM shapes and a 2-bit MoE amplifies that into different expert picks; `TS_GLM_BATCHED_DECODE=0` makes the native side decline it |

#### Sampling defaults (server-only)

These fill in fields the request body omits. CLI flags win over env vars, and
anything set through either outranks the request body unless the server runs
with `--sampling-precedence request` (see [Web Application](#web-application)).

| Sampling field | Env var | CLI equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `temperature` | `TENSORSHARP_TEMPERATURE` | `--temperature` |
| `top_k` | `TENSORSHARP_TOP_K` | `--top-k` |
| `top_p` | `TENSORSHARP_TOP_P` | `--top-p` |
| `min_p` | `TENSORSHARP_MIN_P` | `--min-p` |

| `presence_penalty` | `TENSORSHARP_PRESENCE_PENALTY` | `--presence-penalty` |
| `frequency_penalty` | `TENSORSHARP_FREQUENCY_PENALTY` | `--frequency-penalty` |
| `seed` | `TENSORSHARP_SEED` | `--seed` |
| max tokens | `MAX_TOKENS` | `--max-tokens` |

| sampling precedence | `TENSORSHARP_SAMPLING_PRECEDENCE` | `--sampling-precedence` |

#### Hosting & uploads (server-only)

| Feature | Default | Env vars |
|---|---|---|

| DiffusionGemma Web UI denoising | 48 steps, max batch 2 | `DIFFUSION_STEPS`, `DIFFUSION_MAX_BATCH` |

#### Logging (server + CLI)

|---|---|---|---|
| Console + file log minimum level | `Information` | `TENSORSHARP_LOG_LEVEL` | `--log-level` |
| File logger output directory | `<binDir>/logs` | `TENSORSHARP_LOG_DIR` | `--log-dir` |
| File logger enabled | ON | `TENSORSHARP_LOG_FILE=0` to disable | `--log-file 0\|1` |
| Console logger enabled | ON | — | `--log-console 0\|1` (CLI only) |

#### Native build (compile-time only)

These are read by `build-linux.sh` / `build-windows.ps1` / the auto-build during `dotnet build` for `TensorSharp.GGML.Native`, not at run time.

| Feature | Default | Env vars | Build-script flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enable GGML CUDA in the native build | auto-detected from toolchain | `TENSORSHARP_GGML_NATIVE_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` | `--cuda` / `--no-cuda` |
| Enable GGML Vulkan in the native build | auto-detected from the installed Vulkan runtime; a portable toolchain (headers, glslc, SPIRV-Headers) is downloaded when no Vulkan SDK / dev packages are installed | `TENSORSHARP_GGML_NATIVE_ENABLE_VULKAN=ON/OFF` | `--vulkan` / `--no-vulkan` |
| Narrow `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` list | auto-detected from visible GPU | `TENSORSHARP_GGML_NATIVE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` | `--cuda-arch='86-real;89-real'` |
| Native build parallelism cap | all CPUs, bounded by RAM (~3 GB per `nvcc` job) | `TENSORSHARP_GGML_NATIVE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` | — |
| Native build CMake generator (Windows) | Ninja when available, else `Visual Studio NN` | `CMAKE_GENERATOR` | `-G <generator>` |
| Visual Studio installation used by the native build (Windows) | auto-detected, including installs flagged incomplete | `TENSORSHARP_VS_INSTALL_DIR` | — |

## Server Logging

The server emits one structured Information-level entry at the start and end of
every chat / generate turn, so a single grep over the log file provides a compact
request-response audit trail without replaying any traffic.

| Event id | Emitted on | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `ChatStarted` (1500) | `chat.start`, `generate.start`, plus per-protocol request banners | sampling config, message + attachment counts, `userInput=` (bounded latest-user preview), and `fullInput=` (JSON array of every message with attachment paths, original character counts, and bodies capped at 512 characters). Inlined uploaded documents are replaced by an omission marker while retaining the user's trailing instruction. `/api/generate` likewise logs a bounded prompt preview. |
| `ChatCompleted` (1502) | `chat.complete`, `generate.complete` | token counts, KV cache reuse (`kvReused`, `kvReusePercent`), TTFT, elapsed, throughput, finish reason, full raw assistant output (reasoning + result) |
| `ChatAborted` (1503) | client disconnected mid-stream | partial output, KV reuse fraction at the time of abort |
| `KvCacheReusePlan` (1510) | per-prefix-reuse decision | `Debug`-level fine-grained breakdown (exact match / partial / full reset) |
| `HttpRequestStarted/Completed` (1100/1101) | every HTTP request | method, path, remote IP, status, duration; `/api/queue/status` is demoted to `Debug` so high-frequency UI polling does not drown out the per-turn entries |

The raw assistant output captures `<think>...</think>`, `<|channel|>analysis`,
and any other inline framing the model emits, so the completion entry contains
both reasoning and the user-visible result. Input bodies are deliberately bounded:
losslessly uploaded documents are not duplicated into logs, avoiding large memory/I/O
spikes and accidental document disclosure. The upload manifest and `contentChars`
retain useful audit metadata; capture requests separately when byte-for-byte replay is
required. Set `TENSORSHARP_LOG_LEVEL=Warning` to suppress per-turn Information logs.

Sample `fullInput` payload (formatted for readability; it is emitted as a
single line in the actual log):

```json
[
  {"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant.","contentChars":28},
  {"role":"user","content":"What is the tallest mountain?","contentChars":29},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"Mount Everest.","contentChars":14},
  {"role":"user","content":"How tall is it?","contentChars":15,"images":["/uploads/mountain.jpg"]}
]
```

The same per-turn KV cache reuse stats are surfaced through every API:

- **Web UI SSE** (`POST /api/chat`) - the `done` event carries `promptTokens`, `kvReusedTokens`, and `kvReusePercent`.
- **Ollama NDJSON** (`POST /api/generate`, `POST /api/chat/ollama`) - the final chunk and the non-streaming response carry `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` (int) and `prompt_cache_hit_ratio` (0..1).
- **OpenAI** (`POST /v1/chat/completions`) - the `usage` block carries `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, matching the OpenAI extension that existing SDKs already understand.

The Web UI footer line under each assistant message also surfaces the cache hit
inline (e.g. `187 tokens · 2.1s · 87.2 tok/s · KV 420/512 (82%)`).

## HTTP APIs

TensorSharp.Server exposes three API styles. See [API_EXAMPLES.md](TensorSharp.Server/API_EXAMPLES.md) for full documentation with curl and Python examples.

**Ollama-compatible API:**

```bash
# List models
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tags

# Generate text
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf", "prompt": "Hello!", "stream": false}'

# Chat
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/ollama \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}], "stream": false}'

# Chat with thinking mode
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/ollama \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve 17*23"}], "think": true, "stream": false}'

# Chat with tool calling
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/ollama \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather?"}], "tools": [{"function": {"name": "get_weather", "description": "Get current weather", "parameters": {"properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["city"]}}}], "stream": false}'
```

**OpenAI-compatible API:**

```bash
# Chat completions
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}], "max_tokens": 50}'

# Structured outputs (OpenAI response_format)
#
# Enforced by grammar-constrained decoding: the schema is compiled to a grammar
# and any token that would break it is removed from the distribution before
# sampling, so the response is structurally valid by construction rather than
# repaired afterwards. Supported keywords: type, enum, const, properties,
# required, additionalProperties, items, prefixItems, min/maxItems, anyOf, oneOf,
# allOf, $ref/$defs (including recursive), min/maxLength, pattern, the
# date/time/date-time/uuid formats, and integer minimum/maximum.
# Refused up front (a CFG cannot express them): not, if/then/else,
# dependentSchemas, dependentRequired, multipleOf, patternProperties.
# Set TS_JSON_GRAMMAR=0 to fall back to the older prompt-and-repair behaviour.
#
# NOTE: the grammar guarantees what it emits is well-formed, but it cannot
# guarantee the document FITS in max_tokens. Because end-of-sequence stays
# masked until the JSON is complete, too small a budget truncates mid-object.
# Give structured requests enough headroom.
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract the city and country from: Paris, France."}],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",

          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

    model="gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+3?"}],
    max_tokens=50
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
